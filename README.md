# lesson2
This lesson was done as a practice to learn SVM(Support Vecotr Machine).I trained the model and realised that SVM takes way more training time as compared to Naive_Baiyes.
However,if we reduced the training set to its original 1% size ,the accuracy came down to 89% as compared to 99% earlier and it was observed that now the training time was reduced siginificantly.
Reducing the dataset significantly helps in cases when we need to act real quick like detecting fraud in card payment or voice recognition feature of Siri.
