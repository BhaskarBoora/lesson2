# lesson2
This lesson was done as a practice to learn SVM(Support Vecotr Machine).I trained the model and realised that SVM takes way more training time as compared to Naive_Baiyes.
However,if we reduced the training set to its original 1% size ,the accuracy came down to 89% as compared to 99% earlier and it was observed that now the training time was reduced siginificantly.
Reducing the dataset significantly helps in cases when we need to act real quick like detecting fraud in card payment or voice recognition feature of Siri.
Naive Bayes is great for text--it’s faster and generally gives better performance than an SVM for this particular problem. Of course, there are plenty of other problems where an SVM might work better. Knowing which one to try when you’re tackling a problem for the first time is part of the art and science of machine learning. In addition to picking your algorithm, depending on which one you try, there are parameter tunes to worry about as well, and the possibility of overfitting (especially if you don’t have lots of training data).
